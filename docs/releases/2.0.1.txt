hendrix 2.0.1 release notes
===========================

*February 2, 2016*

Bugfix release
--------------

* Fixed issues:
** https://github.com/hendrix/hendrix/issues/114

The documentation for testing asynchrony says that the responseless_fallback case will run the crosstown_task synchronously and in the calling thread (see: https://hendrix.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing-asynchrony/).

However, this was not the current behavior. Instead, it ran in the crosstown_traffic threadpool.

Fixes this.
