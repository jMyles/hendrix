hendrix 2.0.2 release notes
===========================

*February 11, 2016*

Bugfix release
--------------

* Fixed issues:
** https://github.com/hendrix/hendrix/issues/115
** https://github.com/hendrix/hendrix/issues/117

Logging was broken in one case of adding a child to a HendrixResource.

Also, in some conditions, a runaway log file was created, rapidly growing to several gigs.

Good job @billjohnston noticing the logging problem.  And @vepkenez with the ballooning log file.

And thanks to new contributors @frmdstryr and @jrmarti3 for the rockin' test.
